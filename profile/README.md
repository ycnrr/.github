### We are a multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians researching ways to promote functional recovery following spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain. Herein we endeavor to make our analysis methods and datasets accessible to others in hope that the effects of nervous system damage will be substantially mitigated, or completely reversed.
